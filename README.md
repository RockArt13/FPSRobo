# FPSRobo
Simple Turret Shooting Game (FPS)

# #AboutTheProject
This is a hobby project made during 8 hourse

The project's primary focus is to create a FPS game. The player is controlling a turret, the enemies keep spawning some distance away. They start moving from cover to cover towards the player position. If enemies have reached the player enough times, the game is over. In the end, the player should get a score.

The important keys are

## 1. Level Design

## 2. Turret (script, UI, logic)

## 3. Enemy (script, AI, UI)

## 4. Non-enemy destroyable items

## 5. Player Info UI (scores, waves, rouns, killcount, lives, etc.)

## 6. Menus (death screen, restart screen, opening scene)
